# storage policies are defined here and determine various characteristics
# about how objects are stored and treated.  Policies are specified by name on
# a per container basis.  Names are case-insensitive.  The policy index is
# specified in the section header and is used internally.  The policy with
# index 0 is always used for legacy containers and can be given a name for use
# in metadata however the ring file name will always be 'object.ring.gz' for
# backwards compatibility.  If no policies are defined a policy with index 0
# will be automatically created for backwards compatibility and given the name
# Policy-0.  A default policy is used when creating new containers when no
# policy is specified in the request.  If no other policies are defined the
# policy with index 0 will be declared the default.  If multiple policies are
# defined you must define a policy with index 0 and you must specify a
# default.  It is recommended you always define a section for
# storage-policy:0.
[storage-policy:0]
name = Policy-0
default = yes

# the following section would declare a policy called 'silver', the number of
# replicas will be determined by how the ring is built.  In this example the
# 'silver' policy could have a lower or higher # of replicas than the
# 'Policy-0' policy above.  The ring filename will be 'object-1.ring.gz'.  You
# may only specify one storage policy section as the default.  If you changed
# this section to specify 'silver' as the default, when a client created a new
# container w/o a policy specified, it will get the 'silver' policy because
# this config has specified it as the default.  However if a legacy container
# (one created with a pre-policy version of swift) is accessed, it is known
# implicitly to be assigned to the policy with index 0 as opposed to the
# current default.
